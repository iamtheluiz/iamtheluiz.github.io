# Luiz Vasconcellos Website – SEO Audit & Optimization Report

## 1. Metadata & Technical SEO

**Findings:**
- No robots.txt or sitemap.xml present.
- No evidence of structured data (JSON-LD, Microdata, RDFa).
- Metadata (title, description, canonical, OG tags) could not be verified due to lack of raw HTML, but should be reviewed.

**Recommendations:**
- Add a `robots.txt` file to control crawler access and explicitly allow/disallow as needed.
- Add a `sitemap.xml` to help search engines discover all important pages.
- Ensure every page has a unique, descriptive `<title>` and `<meta name="description">`.
- Add Open Graph and Twitter Card tags for better social sharing.
- Implement structured data (e.g., `Person`, `Organization`, `Project`) using JSON-LD for enhanced search results.

## 2. Content Structure & Keyword Usage

**Findings:**
- Clear sectioning with headings: H1 for name, H2 for main sections, H3/H4 for details.
- Good use of relevant keywords in job/project descriptions.
- H1 is personal but not keyword-optimized.

**Recommendations:**
- Make the H1 more descriptive, e.g., “Luiz Gustavo – Desenvolvedor Frontend e Full Stack”.
- Use only one H1 per page.
- Add relevant keywords to headings where appropriate, but keep them natural.
- Ensure all headings follow a logical hierarchy.

## 3. Accessibility

**Findings:**
- Multiple images (profile, project screenshots) present.
- No direct evidence of alt attributes or ARIA markup.

**Recommendations:**
- Add descriptive `alt` text to all images (e.g., `alt="Screenshot of Gantt Organon project"`).
- Use semantic HTML elements (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`).
- Add ARIA attributes for interactive elements if needed.
- Test color contrast and font size for readability (use Lighthouse or WebAIM).

## 4. Internal Linking & Navigation

**Findings:**
- Sections are clear, but no traditional navigation bar/menu.
- Internal navigation relies on scrolling.

**Recommendations:**
- Add a navigation bar/menu with anchor links to each main section for better UX and crawlability.
- Use descriptive anchor text for all links.
- Ensure all internal links are crawlable and not hidden behind JavaScript.

---

## 5. External Links

**Findings:**
- Many external links to projects, companies, certifications, and social profiles.

**Recommendations:**
- Use `rel="noopener"` and `target="_blank"` for all external links that open in a new tab.
- Use `rel="nofollow"` for untrusted or user-generated content.
- Ensure anchor text is descriptive and relevant.

---

## 6. Performance & Mobile-Friendliness

**Findings:**
- No direct PageSpeed/Lighthouse report, but standard issues likely apply.

**Recommendations:**
- Optimize images (compress, use WebP, size appropriately).
- Minimize JavaScript and CSS bundle sizes.
- Use lazy loading for offscreen images.
- Ensure responsive design and mobile usability.
- Run [PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/) and address flagged issues.

---

## 7. Additional Best Practices

- Regularly update content to keep it fresh and relevant.
- Promote your site through social media and relevant communities.
- Monitor your site in Google Search Console for crawl, index, and performance issues.
